## GET Invoices

[](/documentation/api/accounting/invoices#get-invoices)

Use this method to retrieve one or many invoices.

  * By default responses are formatted as XML. You can also retrieve responses in JSON format.
  * When you retrieve multiple invoices, only a summary of the contact is returned and no line details are returned – this is to keep the response more compact.
  * The line item details will be returned when you retrieve an individual invoice, either by specifying _Invoice ID_ , _Invoice Number_ , querying by _Statuses_ or by using the optional paging parameter (below).
  * When you retrieve invoices by querying by _Statuses_ , pagination is enforced by default.
  * Individual invoices (e.g. Invoices/97c2dc5-cc47-4afd-8ec8-74990b8761e9) can also be returned as PDF's see our [HTTP GET](/documentation/api/accounting/requests-and-responses/#retrieving-individual-resources) documentation

### Optional parameters for GET Invoices

Field| Description  
---|---  
**Record filter**|  You can specify an individual record by appending the value to the endpoint, i.e. `GET https://.../Invoices/{identifier}`   
**InvoiceID** \- The Xero identifier for an Invoice   
e.g. 297c2dc5-cc47-4afd-8ec8-74990b8761e9   
**InvoiceNumber** \- The InvoiceNumber   
e.g. INV-01514  
Modified After| The ModifiedAfter filter is actually an HTTP header: ' **If-Modified-Since** '.   
A UTC timestamp (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss) . Only invoices created or modified since this timestamp will be returned e.g. 2009-11-12T00:00:00  
IDs, InvoiceNumbers, ContactIDs, Statuses| Filter by a comma-separated list of InvoicesIDs, InvoiceNumbers, ContactIDs or Statuses. See [details](/documentation/api/accounting/invoices#optimised-filtering-on-a-list-of-values).  
Where| Filter using the _where_ parameter. We recommend you limit filtering to the [optimised elements](/documentation/api/accounting/invoices#optimised-use-of-the-where-filter) only.  
createdByMyApp| When set to true you'll only retrieve Invoices created by your app  
order| Order by any element returned ( _see[Order By](/documentation/api/accounting/requests-and-responses/#http-get)_ )  
page| Up to 100 invoices will be returned per call, with line items shown for each, when the page parameter is used e.g. page=1  
summaryOnly| When set to true, this returns lightweight fields, excluding computation-heavy fields from the response, making the API calls quick and efficient.  
SearchTerm| Search parameter that performs a case-insensitive text search across the fields: `InvoiceNumber`, `Reference`.  
Example: `GET https://.../Invoices?SearchTerm="REF12"`  
  
### High volume threshold limit

In order to make our platform more stable, we've added a high volume threshold limit for the GET Invoices Endpoint.

  * Requests that have more than 100k invoices being returned in the response will be denied and receive a 400 response code
  * Requests using unoptimised fields for filtering or ordering that result in more than 100k invoices will be denied with a 400 response code



Please continue reading to find out how you can use paging and optimise your filtering to ensure your requests are always successful. Be sure to check out the [Efficient Data Retrieval](/documentation/api/efficient-data-retrieval) page for tips on query optimisation.

### Paging invoices (recommended)

By using paging all the line item details for each invoice are returned which may avoid the need to retrieve each individual invoice.

More information about [retrieving paged resources](/documentation/api/accounting/requests-and-responses#retrieving-paged-resources).

### Optimised use of the where filter

The most common filters have been optimised to ensure performance across organisations of all sizes. We recommend you restrict your filtering to the following optimised parameters.

#### Range Operators in Where clauses

Indicated fields also support the range operators: greater than, greater than or equals, less than, less than or equals (>, >=, <, <=).

Range operators can be combined with the AND operator to query a date or numerical range. eg where=Date>=DateTime(2020, 01, 01) AND Date<DateTime(2020, 02, 01), where=AmountDue>=5000 AND AmountDue<6000

_When using individually or combined with the AND operator:_

Field| Operator| Query  
---|---|---  
Status| equals| where=Status="AUTHORISED"  
Contact.ContactID| equals| where=Contact.ContactID=guid("96988e67-ecf9-466d-bfbf-0afa1725a649")  
Contact.Name| equals| where=Contact.Name="ABC limited"  
Contact.ContactNumber| equals| where=Contact.ContactNumber="ID001"  
Reference| equals| where=Reference="REF12"  
InvoiceNumber| equals| where=InvoiceNumber="INV-001"  
InvoiceId| equals| where=InvoiceId=guid("220ddca8-3144-4085-9a88-2d72c5133734")  
Date| equals, range| where=Date=DateTime(2020, 01, 01)  
where=Date>DateTime(2020, 01, 01)  
Type| equals| where=Type="ACCREC"  
AmountDue| equals, range| where=AmountDue=1000  
where=AmountDue<=5  
AmountPaid| equals| where=AmountPaid=1000  
DueDate| equals, range| where=DueDate=DateTime(2023,11,25)  
where=Date<DateTime(2024, 01, 01)  
  
**Example:** Retrieve all ACCPAY Invoices (bills) with an AUTHORISED status
    
    
    ?where=Type=="ACCPAY" AND Status=="AUTHORISED"

copy code

This would translate to the following URL once encoded.
    
    
    https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/invoices?where=Type%3d%3d%22ACCPAY%22+AND+Status%3d%3d%22AUTHORISED%22

copy code

_When using with the OR operator:_

Field| Operator| Query  
---|---|---  
InvoiceId| equals| where=InvoiceId=guid("220ddca8-3144-4085-9a88-2d72c5133734") or InvoiceId=guid("88192a99-cbc5-4a66-bf1a-2f9fea2d36d0")  
  
Although `where=InvoiceId=guid("220ddca8-3144-4085-9a88-2d72c5133734") or InvoiceId=guid("88192a99-cbc5-4a66-bf1a-2f9fea2d36d0")` and `?IDs=220ddca8-3144-4085-9a88-2d72c5133734,88192a99-cbc5-4a66-bf1a-2f9fea2d36d0` are functionally equivalent, using `?IDs=` can reduce the size of the request. Additionally, the optimisation of the `or` operator is restricted to `InvoiceId` field only. Using `or` with other fields is not optimised and may lead to exceeding the threshold limit.

For optimal performance when querying multiple values for a field, please refer to the next section.

### Optimised filtering on a list of values

The following query parameters allow you to filter on a comma separated list of values:

Field| Query Parameter  
---|---  
Statuses| ?Statuses=AUTHORISED,DRAFT  
IDs| ?IDs=220ddca8-3144-4085-9a88-2d72c5133734,88192a99-cbc5-4a66-bf1a-2f9fea2d36d0  
InvoiceNumbers| ?InvoiceNumbers=INV-001,INV-002,INV-003  
ContactIDs| ?ContactIDs=3138017f-8ddc-420e-a159-e7e1cf9e643d,4b2df4a1-7aa5-4ce3-9e9c-3c55794c5283  
  
**Example:** Retrieve all AUTHORISED and PAID Invoices belonging to two specific contacts
    
    
    https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/invoices?Statuses=AUTHORISED,PAID&ContactIDs=3138017f-8ddc-420e-a159-e7e1cf9e643d,4b2df4a1-7aa5-4ce3-9e9c-3c55794c5283

copy code

### Optimised ordering:

The following parameters are optimised for ordering:

  * InvoiceId
  * UpdatedDateUTC
  * Date



The default order is _UpdatedDateUTC ASC, InvoiceId ASC_. Secondary ordering is applied by default using the InvoiceId. This ensures consistency across pages.

### Retrieving a smaller lightweight response using the _summaryOnly_ parameter

Use _summaryOnly=true_ in GET Invoices endpoint to retrieve a smaller version of the response object. This returns only lightweight fields, excluding computation-heavy fields from the response, making the API calls quick and efficient. The following fields will be **excluded** from the response:

  * Payments
  * HasAttachments
  * LineItems
  * CISDeduction


    
    
    https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/invoices?summaryOnly=True

copy code

The _summaryOnly_ parameter works with other filters, but not when filtering on the excluded fields. And when this parameter is used, pagination is enforced by default.

To integrate your application with Xero's online invoicing, you can retrieve the online invoice url for sales (ACCREC) invoices. Note: you cannot retrieve an online invoice url for DRAFT invoices.

Example for retrieving an online invoice url
    
    
    GET https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Invoices/9b9ba9e5-e907-4b4e-8210-54d82b0aa479/OnlineInvoice

## POST Invoices

[](/documentation/api/accounting/invoices#post-invoices)

Use this method to create or update an invoice

_The following are**required** to create a draft invoice_

Field| Description  
---|---  
Type| See [Invoice Types](/documentation/api/accounting/types#invoices)  
Contact| See [Contacts](/documentation/api/accounting/contacts#)  
LineItems| See LineItems. The LineItems collection can contain any number of individual LineItem sub-elements. At least _**one**_ is required to create a complete Invoice.  
  
_The following are**optional** when creating or updating invoices_

Field| Description  
---|---  
Date| Date invoice was issued – YYYY-MM-DD. If the Date element is not specified it will default to the current date based on the timezone setting of the organisation  
DueDate| Date invoice is due – YYYY-MM-DD  
LineAmountTypes| Line amounts are exclusive of tax by default if you don't specify this element. See [Line Amount Types](/documentation/api/accounting/types#lineamount-types)  
InvoiceNumber| [ACCREC](/documentation/api/accounting/types#invoices) – Unique alpha numeric code identifying invoice ( _when missing will auto-generate from your Organisation Invoice Settings_) (max length = 255)   
[ACCPAY](/documentation/api/accounting/types#invoices) – non-unique alpha numeric code identifying invoice. This value will also display as Reference in the UI. (max length = 255)  
Reference| ACCREC only – additional reference number (max length = 255)  
BrandingThemeID| See [BrandingThemes](/documentation/api/accounting/brandingthemes)  
Url| URL link to a source document – shown as "Go to `[appName]`" in the Xero app  
CurrencyCode| The currency that invoice has been raised in (see [Currencies](/documentation/api/accounting/currencies))  
CurrencyRate| The currency rate for a multicurrency invoice. If no rate is specified, the [XE.com day rate](http://help.xero.com/#CurrencySettings$Rates) is used. (max length = `[18].[6]`)  
Status| See [Invoice Status Codes](/documentation/api/accounting/invoices#invoice-status-codes)

ExpectedPaymentDate| Shown on sales invoices (Accounts Receivable) when this has been set  
PlannedPaymentDate| Shown on bills (Accounts Payable) when this has been set  
  
Elements for LineItems

Field| Description  
---|---  
Description| Description needs to be at least 1 char long. A line item with just a description (i.e no unit amount or quantity) can be created by specifying just a Description element that contains at least 1 character (max length = 4000)  
Quantity| LineItem Quantity (max length = 13)  
UnitAmount| Lineitem unit amount. By default, unit amount will be rounded to two decimal places. You can opt in to use four decimal places by adding the querystring parameter unitdp=4 to your query. See the [Rounding in Xero](/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/rounding-in-xero/#unit-prices) guide for more information.  
ItemCode| See [Items](/documentation/api/accounting/items)  
AccountCode| See [Accounts](/documentation/api/accounting/accounts)  
LineItemID| The Xero generated identifier for a LineItem. It is recommended that you include LineItemIDs on update requests. If LineItemIDs are not included with line items in an update request then the line items are deleted and recreated.  
TaxType| Used as an override if the default Tax Code for the selected AccountCode is not correct – see [TaxTypes](/documentation/api/accounting/types#tax-types).  
TaxAmount| The tax amount is auto calculated as a percentage of the line amount (see below) based on the tax rate. This value can be overriden if the calculated TaxAmount is not correct.  
LineAmount| The line amount reflects the discounted price if a DiscountRate has been used i.e LineAmount = Quantity * Unit Amount * ((100 – DiscountRate)/100) (can't exceed 9,999,999,999.99 )  
DiscountRate or DiscountAmount| Percentage discount or discount amount being applied to a line item. Only supported on [ACCREC](/documentation/api/accounting/types#invoices) invoices and quotes. ACCPAY invoices and credit notes in Xero do not support discounts  
Tracking| Section for optional Tracking Category – see TrackingCategory. Any LineItem can have a maximum of 2 TrackingCategory elements.  
  
Elements for TrackingCategory

Field| Description  
---|---  
Name| Name of the tracking category (required)  
Option| Name of the option (required)  
  
### Creating, updating and deleting line items when updating invoices

In an update (POST) request:

  * Providing an existing LineItem with its LineItemID will update that line item.
  * Providing a LineItem with no LineItemID will create a new line item.
  * Not providing an existing LineItem with it's LineItemID will result in that line item being deleted.



### Addresses on Invoices

By default, the address applied to an invoice will use the postal (POBOX) address of the Contact. However, This can be changed in Xero by applying a [custom invoice template](https://help.xero.com/nz/Q_InvoiceContact). It is not possible to manually override the address on a per-invoice basis.

### Invoice Status Codes

When creating new invoices or modifying existing invoices you can optionally specify a "Status" element. New invoices can have either one of the following three status codes :

Field| Description  
---|---  
**Status**| **Description**  
DRAFT| \- The default status if this element is not provided with your API call  
\- Can contain incomplete line items (e.g. missing account codes)  
\- No journals are created so the details will not be used in any reports  
SUBMITTED| \- Useful if there is an approval process required  
\- No journals are created so the details will not be used in any reports  
AUTHORISED| \- The "approved" state of an invoice ready for sending to a customer  
\- Journals are created in Xero so all details will be used in reports  
\- You can now apply [payments](/documentation/api/accounting/payments) to the invoice  
\- Once an invoice is fully paid invoice the status will change to PAID  
  
### Invoice status changes

The following state changes are valid when updating invoices.

**Existing status**| **New status**  
---|---  
DRAFT| DRAFT  
DRAFT| SUBMITTED  
DRAFT| AUTHORISED  
DRAFT| DELETED  
SUBMITTED| SUBMITTED  
SUBMITTED| AUTHORISED  
SUBMITTED| DRAFT  
SUBMITTED| DELETED  
AUTHORISED| AUTHORISED  
AUTHORISED| VOIDED  
  
### Updating Invoices

You can only update an invoice depending on the type of invoice, and its payment status.

| **ACCREC**| **ACCPAY**  
---|---|---  
Unpaid| Yes| Yes  
Paid (in part, or in full)| Yes – with exceptions below| No  
In a locked period| No| No  
  
If an invoice is paid in part or in full, you can only update the following fields:

  * `Reference`
  * `DueDate`
  * `InvoiceNumber`
  * `BrandingThemeID`
  * `Contact`, unless the payment is made with a Credit Note
  * `URL`
  * `LineItems`
    * `Description`
    * `AccountCode`, except for Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) account codes
    * `Tracking`



### Creating a PAID Invoice

Creating a PAID invoice is a two step process:

  * First an AUTHORISED invoice needs to be made using the Invoices endpoint.
  * Second a payment for the outstanding amount needs to be applied using the [payments](/documentation/api/accounting/payments) endpoint.



Once the invoice has been fully paid the system will move it to the PAID status.

### Deleting and Voiding Invoices

You can delete a DRAFT or SUBMITTED invoice by updating the Status to DELETED.

If an invoice has been AUTHORISED it cannot be deleted but you can set it's status to VOIDED

If you send invoices from your app you can mark them as sent in Xero by setting SentToContact as true

Example of deleting a draft invoice
    
    
    POST https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Invoices/INV-239

copy code
    
    
    {
        "InvoiceNumber": "INV-239",
        "Status": "DELETED"
    }

Example of voiding an approved invoice that has no payments applied to it
    
    
    POST https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Invoices/INV-123

copy code
    
    
    {
        "InvoiceNumber": "INV-123",

### SummarizeErrors

If you are entering many invoices in a single API call then we recommend you utilise our response format that shows validation errors for each invoice. Each Invoice will be returned with a status element that contains the value OK or ERROR. If an invoice has a error then one or more validation errors will be returned.

Example of the altered response format using the SummarizeErrors=false parameter
    
    
    POST https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Invoices?SummarizeErrors=false
    
    

copy code
    
    
    {
      "Invoices": [
        ...
        {
          "ValidationErrors": [
            {
              "Message": "...."
            }
          ]
        }
        ...
      ]
    }

### Uploading an Attachment

You can upload up to 10 attachments (each up to 25mb in size) per invoice, once the invoice has been created in Xero. To do this you'll need to know the ID of the invoice which you'll use to construct the URL when POST/PUTing a byte stream containing the attachment file. e.g. <https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Invoices/> _f0ec0d8c-6fce-4330-bb3b-8306278c6fd8_ /Attachments/ _image.png_. See the [Attachments](/documentation/api/accounting/attachments) page for more details.

Example of uploading an attachment
    
    
    POST /api.xro/2.0/Invoices/f0ec0d8c-4330-bb3b-83062c6fd8/Attachments/Image002932.png

copy code
    
    
        Headers:
        Authorization: Bearer...
        Content Type: image/png
        Content-Length: 10293
        Body:
        {RAW-IMAGE-CONTENT}

## Emailing an invoice

[](/documentation/api/accounting/invoices#emailing-an-invoice)

You can use the API to trigger the email of a sales invoice out of Xero. The invoice must be of Type ACCREC and a valid Status for sending (SUBMITTED,AUTHORISED or PAID).

The email will be sent to the primary email address of the contact on the invoice and any additional contact persons that have IncludeInEmails flag set to true. The sender will be the user who authorised the app connection.

The subject and body of the email will generated from the organisation’s default template. You can read more about email templates [here](https://help.xero.com/EmailTemplates).

There is a daily limit per Xero organisation for sending invoices. This includes emails sent via the app and the API:

  * 1000 per day for paying organisations
  * 20 per day for trial/demo organisations.



We recommend that you monitor the number of emails sent per organisation to avoid hitting these limits. Xero monitors the emails it sends to detect potential spam and protect our email reputation. It's important to us that our customers’ email gets through. If your application receives a 400 rate limit error prior to exceeding the email limits above this is a result of the organisation being restricted due to suspicious activity. We suggest you either try again later or direct the customer to make contact with [Xero Support](https://central.xero.com/s/contact-support).

Please note: The response code returned for a successful request is a 204 (no content). Bad requests, including rate limit hits, will be returned as a 400 (e.g. if the invoice is an invalid status)

An example request to trigger an email
    
    
    POST https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Invoices/aa682059-c8ec-44b9-bc7f-344c94e1ffae/Email

## PUT Invoices

[](/documentation/api/accounting/invoices#put-invoices)

The PUT method is similar to the POST Invoices method, however you can only create new invoices with this method.

## Webhooks

[](/documentation/api/accounting/invoices#webhooks)

You can create a subscription to get invoice events. Create and update events are available (incuding when invoices are archived). See the [Webhooks](/documentation/guides/webhooks/overview/) page for more details.

### Retrieving History

View a summary of the actions made by all users to the invoice. See the [History and Notes](/documentation/api/accounting/historyandnotes) page for more details.
