## Reconcile via the API

[](/documentation/api/accounting/bankstatements#reconcile-via-the-api)

There are no immediate plans to allow the reconciliation of bank statement lines via the Xero API. We are keen to get your feedback on this. If it is a feature you would like to use, please vote (and optionally leave a comment on your own specific use case) in our Uservoice forum [here](http://xero.uservoice.com/forums/5528-xero-api/suggestions/2884040-reconcile-via-the-api). Voting will ensure you will be notified of any developments.##
