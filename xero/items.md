### Tracked vs Untracked Items

If an item is tracked it means Xero tracks the quantity on hand and value of the item. There are stricter business rules around tracked items to facilitate this e.g. you can't create a sales invoice for that item if you don't have sufficient quantity on hand.

Untracked items are goods or services you can specify on transactions but Xero does not track quantities on hand or total value.

Read more about tracked and untracked items in [Xero's help centre](https://help.xero.com/nz/InventoryOptions).

## GET Items

[](/documentation/api/accounting/items#get-items)

Use this method to retrieve either one or many items.

The following elements are returned in the Items response:

|   
---|---  
ItemID| Xero generated identifier for an item (unique within organisations)  
Code| User defined item code  
Name| The name of the item  
IsSold| Boolean value. When IsSold is true the item will be available on sales transactions in the Xero UI.  
IsPurchased| Boolean value. When IsPurchased is true the item is available for purchase transactions in the Xero UI.  
Description| The sales description of the item  
PurchaseDescription| The purchase description of the item  
PurchaseDetails| See Purchases & Sales. The PurchaseDetails element can contain a number of individual sub-elements.  
SalesDetails| See Purchases & Sales. The SalesDetails element can contain a number of individual sub-elements.

InventoryAssetAccountCode| The inventory asset [account](/documentation/api/accounting/accounts/) for the item. The account must be of type `INVENTORY`. The COGSAccountCode in PurchaseDetails is also required to create a tracked item

---|---  
UnitPrice| Unit Price of the item. By default UnitPrice is rounded to two decimal places. You can use 4 decimal places by adding the [unitdp=4](/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/rounding-in-xero#unit-prices) querystring parameter to your request.

### Adjusting the quantity and value of tracked items

The Quantity and TotalCostPool elements are read-only. They cannot be explicitly set via the Items endpoint. The only way to change the quantity and value of tracked items is by creating accounting transactions.

Increase the value and quantity of a tracked item by creating purchase transactions (ACCPAY [Invoices](/documentation/api/accounting/invoices/) or SPEND [BankTransactions](/documentation/api/banktransactions/)) and decrease the value and quantity of tracked items by creating sales transactions (ACCREC [Invoices](/documentation/api/accounting/invoices/) or RECEIVE [BankTransactions](/documentation/api/accounting/banktransactions/)). Read more about inventory adjustments in our [Tracked Inventory in Xero](/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/tracked-inventory-in-xero/) guide.
