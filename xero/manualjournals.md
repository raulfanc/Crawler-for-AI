UpdatedDateUTC| Last modified date UTC format  
  
Elements for Journal Lines. These elements are returned if they contain a value.

LineAmount| total for line. Debits are positive, credits are negative value  
AccountCode| See [Accounts](/documentation/api/accounting/accounts)  
Description| Description for journal line  
TaxType| Used as an override if the default Tax Code for the selected AccountCode is not correct – see [TaxTypes](/documentation/api/accounting/types#tax-types).

### Optional parameters

|   
---|---  
ManualJournalID| You can specify an individual record by appending the ManualJournalID to the endpoint, i.e. `GET https://.../ManualJournals/{identifier}`  
Modified After| The ModifiedAfter filter is actually an HTTP header: ' **If-Modified-Since** '. A UTC timestamp (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss) . Only manual journals created or modified since this timestamp will be returned e.g. 2009-11-12T00:00:00  
Where| Filter by an any element ( _see[Filters](/documentation/api/accounting/requests-and-responses#retrieving-modified-resources)_ )  
order| Order by any element returned ( _see[Order By](/documentation/api/accounting/requests-and-responses#ordering-of-results)_ )  
page| Up to 100 manual journals will be returned per call, with journal lines shown for each, when the page parameter is used e.g. page=1  
  
### High volume threshold limit

In order to make our platform more stable, we've added a high volume threshold limit for the GET Manual Journals Endpoint.

  * Requests that have more than 100k manual journals being returned in the response will be denied
  * Requests using unoptimised fields for filtering or ordering that result in more than 100k manual journals will be denied with a 400 response code



Please continue reading to find out how you can use paging and optimise your filtering to ensure your requests are always successful. Be sure to check out the [Efficient Data Retrieval](/documentation/api/efficient-data-retrieval) page for tips on query optimisation.

### Paging ManualJournals (recommended)

By using paging all the journal line details for each manual journal are returned which may avoid the need to retrieve each individual manual journal.

More information about [retrieving paged resources](/documentation/api/accounting/requests-and-responses#retrieving-paged-resources).

### Optimised use of the where filter

The most common filters have been optimised to ensure performance across organisations of all sizes. We recommend you restrict your filtering to the following optimised parameters.

Field| Operator| Query  
---|---|---  
Narration| equals| where=Narration="narrationtext"  
  
**Example:** Retrieve all ManualJournals where the narration field is "mynarration":
    
    
    ?where=Narration=="mynarration"

copy code

This would translate to the following URL once encoded.
    
    
    https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/ManualJournals?where=Narration%3D%3D%22mynarration%22

copy code

### Optimised ordering

The following parameters are optimised for ordering:

  * ManualJournalID
  * UpdatedDateUTC
  * Date



The default order is _UpdatedDateUTC ASC_.

There are a few accounts that you can't use when entering manual journals in Xero. These include system accounts (accounts receivable, accounts payable & retained earnings) and bank accounts. You will receive a 400 validation error if you try and use these reserved accounts. Consider setting up one or more clearing accounts if you need to journal to a bank account.

## PUT ManualJournals

[](/documentation/api/accounting/manualjournals#put-manualjournals)

The PUT method is similar to the POST ManualJournals method, however you can only create new manual journals with this method.

Example request with minimum elements to add a new draft manual journal

### Uploading an Attachment

You can upload up to 10 attachments (each up to 25mb in size) per manual journal, once the manual journal has been created in Xero. To do this you'll need to know the ID of the manual journal which you'll use to construct the URL when POST/PUTing a byte stream containing the attachment file. e.g. <https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/ManualJournals/> _f0ec0d8c-6fce-4330-bb3b-8306278c6fd8_ /Attachments/ _image.png_. See the [Attachments](/documentation/api/accounting/attachments) page for more details.

Example of uploading an attachment
    
    
    POST /api.xro/2.0/ManualJournals/f0ec0d8c-4330-bb3b-83062c6fd8/Attachments/Image002932.png

copy code
    
    
    Headers:
    Authorization: Bearer...
    Content Type: image/png
    Content-Length: 10293
    Body:
    {RAW-IMAGE-CONTENT}
